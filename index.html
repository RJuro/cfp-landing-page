            <h2>Background</h2>
            <div class="expandable-content">
                <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI are revolutionizing how we understand innovation economics and measure the economic impacts of technological change. In innovation studies and innovation economics, these tools facilitate novel approaches to causal identification, enable scalable analysis of previously intractable economic questions, and open new frontiers in understanding how AI technologies reshape market dynamics, productivity patterns, and policy outcomes including within specific sectors such as healthcare, energy, science, education, and public policy.</p>
                <div class="more-text">
                    <p>However, innovation economics has yet to fully harness the potential of emerging AI-driven LLM methods for addressing core economic questions about innovation performance, R&D patterns, and technological diffusion. With efforts to integrate these techniques, there is a growing need for researchers to exchange best practices and discuss both the potential and methodological limitations inherent to these novel approaches.</p>
