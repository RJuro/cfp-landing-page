Workshop: Applying LLMs and GenAI in Innovation Economics – Potentials and Pitfalls
A two-day workshop at Aalborg University Business School, Denmark on December 8-9, 2025

Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI are revolutionizing how we understand innovation economics and measure the economic impacts of technological change. In innovation studies and innovation economics, these tools facilitate novel approaches to causal identification, enable scalable analysis of previously intractable economic questions, and open new frontiers in understanding how AI technologies reshape market dynamics, productivity patterns, and policy outcomes across various sectors.

However, innovation economics has yet to fully harness the potential of emerging AI-driven methods. With efforts to integrate these techniques, there is a growing need for researchers to exchange best practices and discuss both the potential and methodological limitations inherent to these novel approaches. This workshop provides a dedicated platform for this critical exchange.

Keynote Speaker
We are honored to welcome Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen as our keynote speaker.

Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen is an Associate Professor of Economics and Social Data Science at the University of Copenhagen and a core member of SODAS (Copenhagen Center for Social Data Science). His research sits at the intersection of economics, data science, and public policy, with a notable focus on education. Across his work, he combines econometric identification with modern machine learning to build policy-relevant, auditable predictive systems.

Methodologically, Bjerre-Nielsen is known for investigating what kinds of data and models genuinely improve out-of-sample performance while preserving privacy and interpretability. His work offers a crucial, method-first perspective for our workshop, addressing how to select effective data, blend causal identification with predictive modeling, and navigate the complex trade-offs of fairness, transparency, and oversight when algorithmic tools are deployed in high-stakes public and economic decisions. His experience in designing efficient, privacy-aware AI pipelines provides an invaluable lesson for researchers in innovation economics.
