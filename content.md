## Overview (`#overview`)
### Heading
- Why This Workshop

### Body Copy
1. Large Language Models and Generative AI are reshaping how economists study innovation, enabling causal insights, richer measurement, and new views on technological change. This workshop convenes researchers who advance these methods in innovation economics, share practical playbooks, and surface emerging risks around data quality, reproducibility, and responsible deployment.
2. With the call for papers closed, this site now focuses on coordination for confirmed participants. Keep an eye on programme drafts and practical updates as we move toward December.

### Highlight List
- Programme outline (below) will be iterated with final times and rooms in November.
- Full manuscript submissions for the Paper Development track closed on 17 October; materials are now circulating to reviewers.
- Reviewer assignments circulate 7 November, with revisions requested by 28 November.
